# Agent-Based Simulation for Disease Spread in Cities and Regions

## 3. Input files

Several input files are used to configure a medlabs experiment. Each of the input files is described in a separate document.

- 3.1. [Disease properties file](3-1-input-disease.md).
- 3.2. [Activity schedules](3-2-input-activities.md).
- 3.3. [People](3-3-input-people.md).
- 3.4. [Location types](3-4-input-location-types.md).
- 3.5. [Locations](3-5-input-locations.md).
- 3.6. [Policies](3-6-input-policies.md). 

Neither the folder locations, nor the folder names or file names have any limitations for naming. Do, however, stick to the file formats (.csv, .csv.gz, .xlsx) since the program counts on receiving files of a certain type. If possible, use the proper extensions for the files, since it can be very confusing if the extensions do not match the file content.
