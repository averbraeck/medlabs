# MEDLABS - Agent-Based Simulation for Disease Spread in Cities and Regions

## 4. Output files

Many output files are generated. Typically, a subdirectory of the location where the code is executed is reserved for the output files. If a batch run is executed with multiple seeds, the seed number is attached to the output directory name to avoid files from different replications overwriting each other.

The following files are generated by default:

### 4.1. capacityAllocationProblems.csv

This file stores every hour whether there have been problems with the capacity of certain location types. It stores how many persons tried to enter a location of the given type in the past hour and were not allowed in because of a capacity constraint. The `nrReserved` are persons who are traveling *towards* the location at the end of the hour.

```

```


### 4.2. capacityViolations.csv

This file stores warnings when persons enter a location that is too crowded. Whether or not anything is logged into this file is dependent on the variable `capConstrained` in the location types file. When true, people wait till there is enough space; when false they enter anyhow, but a warning line is reported in this file.

```
"Time(h)","location","nrPersons","surface(m2)","capacityPerM2","personsPerM2"

### 4.3. dayActivityTimes.csv

This file stores per day how many hours each type of person has spent in each type of location:

You can clearly see that only `Worker` goes to the office. But there are also teachers working in the `PrimarySchool`. This information is recorded once every 24 hours.

So, 165 people are in hospital at t=810h, plus 7 in the ICU. 2276 people have recovered already.


### 4.9. infectedPersons.csv

This file provides detailed information about each person that got infected in the model. A very important piece of information is where they got infected. It includes location type (e.g., Supermarket), location Id (to see if certain location instances cause many more infections than others), and the latitude/longitude of the infection location (to plot infections on the map to identify clusters). A value of '-1' means that it is not applicable (e.g., a school id for a Worker).

### 4.10. infections.csv

This file provides information about the person *infecting* and the person who got *infected*, as well as the location where the infection took place.

### 4.11. infectionsByRate.csv

If a rate of infections is given using an R0 factor rather than a disease spread model, the infections are reported in this file, instead of using the files that report disease *transmission* between persons. 

The reported columns look as follows:

```
"Time(h)","personId","personType","Age","Gender","homeId","homeSubId","homeLat","homeLon",
    "diseasePhase","workId","schoolId","infLocation","duration","infRate"
```



### 4.12. infectionsByRateFactor.csv

If a rate of infections is given using a rate factor compared to a reference group in the model, rather than a disease spread model, the infections are reported in this file, instead of using the files that report disease *transmission* between persons. Note that a rate factor is a factor that models the rate of spread compared to a reference group in the model where disease transmissions do take place. An example is to say: "workers outside the city follow the same pattern as workers in the city, but with an 80% chance of getting infected as compared to the workers in the city". The rate factor is 0.8 for that group. The file reports what percentage of the person type in the city has been infected as compared to the total number of citizens for that person type. 

The reported columns look as follows:

```
"Time(h)","personId","personType","Age","Gender","homeId","homeSubId","homeLat","homeLon",
    "diseasePhase","workId","schoolId","infLocation","duration","infRateFactor",
    "refPersonType","nrInfectedRef","nrTotalRef"
```


### 4.13. infectionsPerAge.csv

To make an age graph over time, persons have been divided into age groups spanning 10 years. Reporting is done every hour. During certain hours, e.g., the night, the change for infections is lower. 

```
"Time(h)","0-9","10-19","20-29","30-39","40-49","50-59","60-69","70-79","80-89","90-99","100-109"

### 4.15. locationNrPersons.csv

This is a huge file (can become GB size) that gives detailed information about each and every location with the number of persons in that location, reported every hour.

```

### 4.16. locationTypeNrs.csv

The file `locationTypeNrs.csv` lists per half hour how many people are in one of the Location Types at that point in time. The locations include transport such as walking, biking or driving a car.

```

### 4.17. offspringLocation.csv

This file lists how many people were infected by an infectious person who was at a location. The number is listed when the infectious person leaves the location. Often, the offspring is zero, either because there were no or few susceptible persons at the location, or because the average distance to others was small.

```
"Time(h)","infectiousPersonId","infectiousPersonType","infectiousPersonAge",

The headings clearly list that most properties, except the number of infected persons, are those of the infectious person. This helps to see not only *where* infections take place, but also by what type of person. Is it, e.g., often someone asymptomatically infectious who *works* at a supermarket or shop? This can give some deeper insights into the effects of the social fabric on infections.


### 4.18. sublocationNrPersons.csv

This is a huge file (can become multiple GBs in terms of size) that gives detailed information about each and every location plus sublocation (classroom, office at a workplace, classroom in a school, etc.) with the number of persons in that sublocation, reported every hour.

```
"Time(h)","LocationNr","SubLocationNr","NrPersons"
0.0,84347,1,1
0.0,84347,2,1
0.0,84347,3,1
0.0,84347,4,1
0.0,84347,5,1
0.0,84347,6,1
0.0,84347,7,1
0.0,84347,8,1
0.0,84347,9,1
```

The sublocation nr is the 'room number' within the location when it has been divided into smaller units.


### 4.19. totActivityTimes.csv

This file stores every day the *cumulative* number of hours each type of person has spent in each type of location:
