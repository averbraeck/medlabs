The models are based on the PhD thesis work of Mingxin Zhang at TU Delft, which has been described in detail in the following literature references:

The model runs on top of the DSOL simulation framework (https://simulation.tudelft.nl and https://github.com/averbraeck/dsol). DSOL has been described in the following literature references:
